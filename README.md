This documents my journey into learning to programming the PIC16F676 microcontroller. I am using the Pickit 3 clone as my programmer, and using MPLAB X IDE 5.50 or 6.00 after 19 March 2023. I also installed the XC8 version 2.36 Plugin which allows me to program using the C language.

The PIC16F676 is an older generation microcontroller, and while it is still a popular choice for many projects, it may have some limitations compared to newer microcontrollers. However, it can still be a good choice for simple projects that don't require a lot of processing power or advanced features.

It's good to be aware that some users have reported issues when programming the PIC16F676 with the first version of the Pickit 4 programmer. However, the Pickit 3 should be able to program the microcontroller without any issues.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Microchip does recommend using the PIC16F18324 microcontroller for new designs, as it offers more features and capabilities than the PIC16F676 while still having the same number of pins. However, if you already have the PIC16F676 and it meets your project requirements, it can still be a good choice.

So why am I using the Pic16F676 you may ask and the answer is I already had some of these Pic from MERG (Model Electronic Rail Group) PMP 9 a 4 way traffic light kit to supply the various parts in the first few videos. Also using a simpler microcontroller like the PIC16F676 can have some benefits, such as being easier to learn and understand, having fewer components to connect and debug, and using less power. Additionally, you may be able to reuse the knowledge and code you learn with the PIC16F676 in future projects, regardless of the specific microcontroller you use.

I am using a Windows 10 laptop when using the programming software and hardware.

Each new project will have its own folder and inside that will be documents I feel will help explain the projects. 

Disclaimer

I am not a programmer by trade, but I am someone who likes to have a project to work on and learn and share the knowledge with other people as I progress.
If you find any errors or questions please feel free to contact me either using the issue function or you can use the email address.

Please read the Readme in each of the project folders as these will contain updates that you need to be aware of after making the video. 

I will be adding more details as and when I have more time.
