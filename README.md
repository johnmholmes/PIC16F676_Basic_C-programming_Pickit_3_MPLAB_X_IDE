This documents my journey into learning to programming the PIC16F676 microcontroller. I am using the Pickit 3 clone as my programmer, and using MPLAB X IDE 5.50 or 6.00 after 19 March 2023. I also installed the XC8 version 2.36 Plugin which allows me to program using the C language.

The Pic16F676 is an older generation Pic which is known to have some issues when trying to program them with the first Pickit 4. Also Microchip advise the use of the Pic18324 which offers a lot more options with the same number of Pins

So why am I using the Pic16F676 you may ask and the answer is I already had some of these Pic from MERG (Model Electronic Rail Group) PMP 9 a 4 way traffic light kit to supply the various parts in the first few videos.

See https://www.merg.org.uk/

I am using a Windows 10 laptop when using the programming software and hardware.

Each new project will have its own folder and inside that will be documents I feel will help explain the projects. 

Disclaimer

I am not a programmer by trade, but I am someone who likes to have a project to work on and learn and share the knowledge with other people as I progress.
If you find any errors or questions please feel free to contact me either using the issue function or you can use the email address.

Please read the Readme in each of the project folders as these will contain updates that you need to be aware of after making the video. 

I will be adding more details as and when I have more time.
