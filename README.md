# PIC16F676_Basic_C programming_Pickit_3_MPLAB_X_IDE

Previously I had started to program the PIC16F676 chip using the Pickit 4 with some successbut did have some issues so I swopped over to a Pickit 3 and decided to use a bread board for the experiments.
 
I also used the MERG (Model Electronic Rail Group) PMP 9 4 way traffic light kit to supply the various parts I need for the first 5 videos of this series. This kit is available from their website.

This raposatory cantains the codes used for the Youtube video series in playlist below

More codes will be added after each video.

These codes are my way of doing this sort of programming and is my journey into PIC programming in C. They also serve as a great memory aid for me to look back on as I am not as good a remembering how I do some of this stuff over time. I am not a proffesional coder just a hobbist who likes to learn new things to keep the brain active in retirement.

I am using a Windows 10 laptop with PLAB version 5.5 and XC8 version 2.36 to do my progrmming and there maybe some differences between other versions of either software.
